# 🚀 Updated CI/CD Configuration - Build on VPS

## ✅ Changes Made

### 🔧 **GitHub Actions Workflow Updated**

- **Removed Docker registry steps** - No more GitHub Container Registry usage
- **Simplified pipeline** - Test → Security Audit → Deploy
- **Build on VPS** - Docker image builds directly during deployment
- **Updated secrets** - Changed from `VPS_*` to `HOST_IP`, `USERNAME`, `PRIVATE_KEY`, `PORT`

### 🐳 **Docker Configuration**

- **Local builds only** - Docker Compose already configured for local builds
- **No registry dependencies** - Images built from source on VPS
- **Multi-stage optimization** - Still uses cargo-chef for dependency caching
- **Cost effective** - No registry storage or bandwidth costs

### 📝 **Documentation Updates**

- **Updated CI-CD-GUIDE.md** - Removed registry references
- **Updated CI-CD-SUMMARY.md** - Corrected deployment flow
- **Updated secrets section** - New secret names for clarity

## 🚀 **New Deployment Flow**

1. **Code Push** → GitHub repository
2. **CI Pipeline** → Runs tests and security audit
3. **SSH to VPS** → Connects to your server
4. **Git Pull** → Gets latest code
5. **Docker Build** → Builds image locally with `--build` flag
6. **Service Restart** → Deploys with zero downtime
7. **Health Check** → Verifies deployment success

## 🔑 **Required GitHub Secrets**

```bash
HOST_IP       # Your VPS IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
USERNAME      # SSH username (e.g., ubuntu, root, your-user)
PRIVATE_KEY   # Your private SSH key content
PORT          # SSH port (default: 22)
```

## 📋 **Updated Deployment Command**

The deployment now uses:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

Instead of:

```bash
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

## 🎯 **Benefits of Building on VPS**

### ✅ **Advantages:**

- **No registry costs** - No storage or bandwidth fees
- **Simplified pipeline** - Fewer moving parts
- **Direct deployment** - No push/pull steps
- **Always fresh** - Builds from latest source
- **No registry authentication** - One less thing to configure

### ⚠️ **Considerations:**

- **VPS build time** - Initial builds may take longer
- **VPS resources** - Requires sufficient CPU/RAM for building
- **No image sharing** - Each VPS builds its own image
- **Build dependencies** - VPS needs Docker build tools

## 🔧 **VPS Requirements**

Your VPS should have:

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed
- **Git** for code pulling
- **Sufficient resources** for building:
  - Minimum: 2GB RAM, 2 CPU cores
  - Recommended: 4GB RAM, 4 CPU cores
- **curl** for health checks

## 🏗️ **Build Process**

1. **Dependency layer** - Cached using cargo-chef
2. **Application build** - Compiles your Rust code
3. **Runtime image** - Minimal Debian slim with binary
4. **Service deployment** - Replaces running containers

## 📊 **Expected Build Times**

- **First build**: 5-10 minutes (downloads dependencies)
- **Subsequent builds**: 1-3 minutes (uses cached layers)
- **Code-only changes**: 30-60 seconds (only rebuilds app layer)

## 🎉 **Ready to Deploy!**

Your CI/CD pipeline is now optimized for VPS deployment without any external registries. The build process happens directly on your server, making it simple, cost-effective, and reliable.

To deploy:

1. Configure the GitHub secrets
2. Push to the `master` branch
3. Watch the magic happen! ✨
